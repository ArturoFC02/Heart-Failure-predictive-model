# Heart-Failure-predictive-model

Early detection of CVD is crucial due to its high prevalence and significant risk.
cative that it represents for health. It also allows you to intervene in time and take measures to
control risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes,
obesity and smoking, which can prevent serious complications and improve the quality of
patients' lives.
The goal of this project is to generate and evaluate different capable machine learning models.
to predict whether a patient suffers from cardiovascular disease or is prone to it. AND
thus, being able to contribute to the early detection of CVDs
